# pass is a null statement that does nothing, it is used as a placeholder for future code.
# EX 
# for i in range(5) :
#     pass


# skip for loop statement using pass ,
for i in range(5) :
    #empty                  if loop is empty then return indendent error 
    pass 

print("some useful work ")

# skip if statement using pass ,
if(i > 5) :
    pass 

print("another work ")

# Practice set 
# find the some of first n mubers
n = 7
some = 1
for val in range(1, n+1):
    some += i
    print(some)
print("total some is ", some, "\n")

# using while ioops 
j = 0
some = 1

while j <= 7:
    some += j
    j += 1
    print(some)
print("total some using while loop ", some)

# factorial some of n numbers 
n = 5
